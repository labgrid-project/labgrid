Description: embedded board control python library
 Labgrid is an embedded board control python library with a focus on testing,
 development and general automation. It includes a remote control layer to
 control boards connected to other hosts.
 .
 The idea behind labgrid is to create an abstraction of the hardware control
 layer needed for testing of embedded systems, automatic software installation
 and automation during development. Labgrid itself is not a testing framework,
 but is intended to be combined with pytest (and additional pytest plugins).
