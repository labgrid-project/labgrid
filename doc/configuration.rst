Configuration
=============
This chapter describes the individual drivers and resources used in a device
configuration.
Drivers can depend on resources or other drivers, whereas resources
have no dependencies.

.. image:: res/config_graph.svg
   :width: 50%

Here the resource `RawSerialPort` provides the information for the
`SerialDriver`, which in turn is needed by the `ShellDriver`.
Driver dependency resolution is done by searching for the driver which
implements the dependent protocol, all drivers implement one or more protocols.

Resources
---------

Serial Ports
~~~~~~~~~~~~

RawSerialPort
+++++++++++++
A RawSerialPort is a serial port which is identified via the device path on the
local computer.
Take note that re-plugging USB serial converters can result in a different
enumeration order.

.. code-block:: yaml

   RawSerialPort:
     port: /dev/ttyUSB0
     speed: 115200

The example would access the serial port /dev/ttyUSB0 on the local computer with
a baud rate of 115200.

- port (str): path to the serial device
- speed (int): desired baud rate

Used by:
  - `SerialDriver`_

- name (str): name or pattern of the remote place

Used by:
  - potentially all drivers

udev Matching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
udev matching allows labgrid to identify resources via their udev properties.
Any udev property key and value can be used, path matching USB devices is
allowed as well.
This allows exporting a specific USB hub port or the correct identification of
a USB serial converter across computers.

The initial matching and monitoring for udev events is handled by the
:any:`UdevManager` class.
This manager is automatically created when a resource derived from
:any:`USBResource` (such as :any:`USBSerialPort`, :any:`IMXUSBLoader` or
:any:`AndroidFastboot`) is instantiated.

To identify the kernel device which corresponds to a configured `USBResource`,
each existing (and subsequently added) kernel device is matched against the
configured resources.
This is based on a list of `match entries` which must all be tested
successfully against the potential kernel device.
Match entries starting with an ``@`` are checked against the device's parents
instead of itself; here one matching parent causes the check to be successful.

A given `USBResource` class has builtin match entries that are checked first,
for example that the ``SUBSYSTEM`` is ``tty`` as in the case of the
:any:`USBSerialPort`.
Only if these succeed, match entries provided by the user for the resource
instance are considered.

In addition to the properties reported by ``udevadm monitor --udev
--property``, elements of the ``ATTR(S){}`` dictionary (as shown by ``udevadm
info <device> -a``) are useable as match keys.
Finally ``sys_name`` allows matching against the name of the directory in
sysfs.
All match entries must succeed for the device to be accepted.

The following examples show how to use the udev matches for some common
use-cases.

Matching a USB Serial Converter on a Hub Port
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This will match any USB serial converter connected below the hub port 1.2.5.5
on bus 1.
The `sys_name` value corresponds to the hierarchy of buses and ports as shown
with ``lsusb -t`` and is also usually displayed in the kernel log messages when
new devices are detected.

.. code-block:: yaml

  USBSerialPort:
    match:
      '@sys_name': '1-1.2.5.5'

Note the ``@`` in the ``@sys_name`` match, which applies this match to the
device's parents instead of directly to itself.
This is necessary for the `USBSerialPort` because we actually want to find the
``ttyUSB?`` device below the USB serial converter device.

Matching an Android Fastboot Device
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this case, we want to match the USB device on that port directly, so we
don't use a parent match.

.. code-block:: yaml

  AndroidFastboot:
    match:
      'sys_name': '1-1.2.3'

Matching a Specific UART in a Dual-Port Adapter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

On this board, the serial console is connected to the second port of an
on-board dual-port USB-UART.
The board itself is connected to the bus 3 and port path 10.2.2.2.
The correct value can be shown by running ``udevadm info /dev/ttyUSB9`` in our
case:

.. code-block:: bash
  :emphasize-lines: 21

  $ udevadm info /dev/ttyUSB9
  P: /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb3/3-10/3-10.2/3-10.2.2/3-10.2.2.2/3-10.2.2.2:1.1/ttyUSB9/tty/ttyUSB9

  E: MAJOR=188
  E: MINOR=9
  E: SUBSYSTEM=tty
  E: TAGS=:systemd:
  E: USEC_INITIALIZED=9129609697

We use the ``ID_USB_INTERFACE_NUM`` to distinguish between the two ports:

.. code-block:: yaml

  USBSerialPort:
    match:
      '@sys_name': '3-10.2.2.2'
      'ID_USB_INTERFACE_NUM': '01'

Matching a USB UART by Serial Number
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Most of the USB serial converters in our lab have been programmed with unique
serial numbers.
This makes it easy to always match the same one even if the USB topology
changes or a board has been moved between host systems.

.. code-block:: yaml

  USBSerialPort:
    match:
      'ID_SERIAL_SHORT': 'P-00-00679'

To check if your device has a serial number, you can use ``udevadm info``:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ udevadm info /dev/ttyUSB5 | grep SERIAL_SHORT
  E: ID_SERIAL_SHORT=P-00-00679

SmallUBootDriver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A SmallUBootDriver interfaces with stripped-down UBoot variants that are
sometimes used in cheap consumer electronics.

SmallUBootDriver is meant as a driver for UBoot with only little
functionality compared to standard a standard UBoot.
Especially is copes with the following limitations:

- The UBoot does not have a real password-prompt but can be activated by
  entering a "secret" after a message was displayed.
- The command line is does not have a build-in echo command. Thus this
  driver uses 'Unknown Command' messages as marker before and after the
  output of a command.
- Since there is no echo we can not return the exit code of the command.
  Commands will always return 0 unless the command was not found.

This driver needs the following features activated in UBoot to work:

- The UBoot must not have real password prompt. Instead it must be
  keyword activated.
  For example it should be activated by a dialog like the following:

  - UBoot: "Autobooting in 1s..."
  - Labgrid: "secret"
  - UBoot: <switching to console>

- The UBoot must be able to parse multiple commands in a single
  line separated by ";".
- The UBoot must support the "bootm" command to boot from a
  memory location.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
The SigrokDriver uses a SigrokDriver Resource to record samples and provides
them during test runs.

Binds to:
  sigrok:
    - `SigrokUSBDevice`_
    - `SigrokDevice`_
    - `NetworkSigrokUSBDevice`_

Implements:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :any:`USBSDMuxDriver` uses a USBSDMuxDevice resource to control a
USB-SD-Mux device via `usbsdmux <https://github.com/pengutronix/usbsdmux>`_
tool.

Implements:
  - None yet

The driver can be used in test cases by calling the `set_mode()` function with
argument being `dut`, `host`, `off`, or `client`.

USBVideoDriver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :any:`USBVideoDriver` is used to show a video stream from a remote USB
video camera in a local window.
It uses the GStreamer command line utility ``gst-launch`` on both sides to
stream the video via an SSH connection to the exporter.

Binds to:
  video:
    - `USBVideo`_
    - `NetworkUSBVideo`_

Implements:
  - None yet

Although the driver can be used from Python code by calling the `stream()`
method, it is currenly mainly useful for the ``video`` subcommand of
``labgrid-client``.
It supports the `Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920` with the USB ID 046d:082d, but
other cameras can be added to `get_caps()` in
``labgrid/driver/usbvideodriver.py``.

USBTMCDriver
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The :any:`USBTMCDriver` is used to control a oscilloscope via the USB TMC
protocol.

Binds to:
  tmc:
    - `USBTMC`_
    - `NetworkUSBTMC`_

Implements:
  - None yet

Currently, it can be used by the ``labgrid-client`` ``tmc`` subcommands to show
(and save) a screenshot, to show per channel measurements and to execute raw
TMC commands.
It only supports the `Keysight DSO-X 2000` series (with the USB ID 0957:1798),
but more devices can be added by extending `on_activate()` in
``labgrid/driver/usbtmcdriver.py`` and writing a corresponding backend in
``labgrid/driver/usbtmc/``.

XenaDriver
~~~~~~~~~~
The XenaDriver allows to use Xena networking tests equipment. Using the xenavalkyrie library
a full API to control the tester is available.

Binds to:
  xena_manager:
    - `XenaManager`_

The driver is supposed to work with all Xena products from the "Valkyrie Layer 2-3 Test platform"
Currently tested on a `XenaCompact` chassis equipped with a `1 GE test module`.

Strategies
----------

Strategies are used to ensure that the device is in a certain state during a test. 
Such a state could be the boot loader or a booted Linux kernel with shell.

BareboxStrategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A BareboxStrategy has four states:

- unknown
- off
- barebox
- shell


to transition to the shell state:

::

   t = get_target("main")
   s = BareboxStrategy(t)
   s.transition("shell")


this command would transition from the boot loader into a Linux shell and
activate the shelldriver.

ShellStrategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A ShellStrategy has three states:

- unknown
- off
- shell


to transition to the shell state:

::

   t = get_target("main")
   s = ShellStrategy(t)
   s.transition("shell")


this command would transition directly into a Linux shell and
activate the shelldriver.

UBootStrategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A UBootStrategy has four states:

- unknown
- off
- uboot
- shell


to transition to the shell state:

::

   t = get_target("main")
   s = UBootStrategy(t)
   s.transition("shell")


this command would transition from the boot loader into a Linux shell and
activate the shelldriver.

Reporters
---------

StepReporter
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The StepReporter outputs individual labgrid steps to `STDOUT`.

::

    from labgrid.stepreporter import StepReporter

    StepReporter.start()

The Reporter can be stopped with a call to the stop function:

::

    from labgrid.stepreporter import StepReporter

    StepReporter.stop()

Stopping the StepReporter if it has not been started will raise an
AssertionError, as will starting an already started StepReporter.

ConsoleLoggingReporter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ConsoleLoggingReporter outputs read calls from the console transports into
files. It takes the path as a parameter.

::

    from labgrid.consoleloggingreporter import ConsoleLoggingReporter

    ConsoleLoggingReporter.start(".")

The Reporter can be stopped with a call to the stop function:

::

    from labgrid.consoleloggingreporter import ConsoleLoggingReporter

    ConsoleLoggingReporter.stop()


Stopping the ConsoleLoggingReporter if it has not been started will raise an
AssertionError, as will starting an already started StepReporter.



Environment Configuration
-------------------------
The environment configuration for a test environment consists of a YAML file
which contains targets, drivers and resources.
The invocation order of objects is important here since drivers may depend on
other drivers or resources.

The skeleton for an environment consists of:

.. code-block:: yaml

   targets:
     <target-1>:
       resources:
         <resource-1>:
           <resource-1 parameters>
         <resource-2>:
           <resource-2 parameters>
       drivers:
         <driver-1>:
           <driver-1 parameters>
         <driver-2>: {} # no parameters for driver-2
     <target-2>:
       resources:
         <resources>
       drivers:
         <drivers>
     <more targets>
   options:
     <option-1 name>: <value for option-1>
     <more options>
   images:
     <image-1 name>: <absolute or relative path for image-1>
     <more images>
   tools:
     <tool-1 name>: <absolute or relative path for tool-1>
     <more tools>
   imports:
     - <import.py>
     - <python module>

If you have a single target in your environment, name it "main", as the
``get_target`` function defaults to "main".

All the resources and drivers in this chapter have a YAML example snippet which
can simply be added (at the correct indentation level, one level deeper) to the
environment configuration.

If you want to use multiple drivers of the same type, the resources and drivers
need to be lists, e.g:

.. code-block:: yaml

  resources:
    RawSerialPort:
      port: '/dev/ttyS1'
  drivers:
    SerialDriver: {}

becomes:

.. code-block:: yaml

  resources:
  - RawSerialPort:
      port: '/dev/ttyS1'
  - RawSerialPort:
      port: '/dev/ttyS2'
  drivers:
  - SerialDriver: {}
  - SerialDriver: {}

This configuration doesn't specifiy which :any:`RawSerialPort` to use for each
:any:`SerialDriver`, so it will cause an exception when instantiating the
:any:`Target`.
To bind the correct driver to the correct resource, explicit ``name`` and
``bindings`` properties are used:

.. code-block:: yaml

  resources:
  - RawSerialPort:
      name: 'foo'
      port: '/dev/ttyS1'
  - RawSerialPort:
      name: 'bar'
      port: '/dev/ttyS2'
  drivers:
  - SerialDriver:
      name: 'foo_driver'
      bindings:
        port: 'foo'
  - SerialDriver:
      name: 'bar_driver'
      bindings:
        port: 'bar'

The property name for the binding (e.g. `port` in the example above) is
documented for each individual driver under this chapter.

The YAML configuration file also supports templating for some substitutions,
these are:

- LG_* variables, are replaced with their respective LG_* environment variable
- BASE is substituted with the base directory of the YAML file.

As an example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  targets:
    main:
      resources:
        RemotePlace:
          name: !template $LG_PLACE
  tools:
    qemu_bin: !template "$BASE/bin/qemu-bin"

would resolve the qemu_bin path relative to the BASE dir of the YAML file and
try to use the RemotePlace with the name set in the LG_PLACE environment
variable.

Exporter Configuration
----------------------
The exporter is configured by using a YAML file (with a syntax similar to the
environment configs used for pytest) or by instantiating the :any:`Environment`
object.
To configure the exporter, you need to define one or more `resource groups`,
each containing one or more `resources`.
This allows the exporter to group resources for various usage scenarios, e.g.
all resources of a specific place or for a specific test setup.
For information on how the exporter fits into the rest of labgrid, see
:any:`remote-resources-and-places`.

The basic structure of an exporter configuration file is:

.. code-block:: yaml

   <group-1>:
     <resources>
   <group-2>:
     <resources>

The simplest case is with one group called "group1" containing a single
:any:`USBSerialPort`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   group1:
     USBSerialPort:
       match:
         '@sys_name': '3-1.3'

To reduce the amount of repeated declarations when many similar resources
need to be exported, the `Jinja2 template engine <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_
is used as a preprocessor for the configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ## Iterate from group 1001 to 1016
   # for idx in range(1, 17)
   {{ 1000 + idx }}:
     NetworkSerialPort:
       {host: rl1, port: {{ 4000 + idx }}}
     NetworkPowerPort:
       # if 1 <= idx <= 8
       {model: apc, host: apc1, index: {{ idx }}}
       # elif 9 <= idx <= 12
       {model: netio, host: netio4, index: {{ idx - 8 }}}
       # elif 13 <= idx <= 16
       {model: netio, host: netio5, index: {{ idx - 12 }}}
       # endif
   # endfor

Use ``#`` for line statements (like the for loops in the example) and ``##``
for line comments.
Statements like ``{{ 4000 + idx }}`` are expanded based on variables in the
Jinja2 template.
