Development
============
The first step is to install labgrid into a local virtualenv.

Installation
------------

Clone the git repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid && cd labgrid

Create and activate a virtualenv for labgrid:

.. code-block:: bash

   virtualenv -p python3 venv
   source venv/bin/activate

Install required dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install libow-dev

Install the development requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

Install labgrid into the virtualenv in editable mode:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e .

Tests can now be run via:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pytest --lg-env <config>

Writing a Driver
----------------

To develop a new driver for labgrid, you need to decide which protocol to
implement, or implement your own protocol.
If you are unsure about a new protocol's API, just use the driver directly from
the client code, as deciding on a good API will be much easier when another
similar driver is added.

Labgrid uses the `attrs library <https://attrs.readthedocs.io>`_ for internal
classes.
First of all import attr, the protocol and the common driver class
into your new driver file.

::

    import attr

    from labgrid.driver.common import Driver
    from labgrid.protocol import ConsoleProtocol

Next, define your new class and list the protocols as subclasses of the new
driver class.
Try to avoid subclassing existing other drivers, as this limits the flexibility
provided by connecting drivers and resources on a given target at runtime.

::

    import attr

    from labgrid.driver.common import Driver
    from labgrid.protocol import ConsoleProtocol

    @attr.s(cmp=False)
    class ExampleDriver(Driver, ConsoleProtocol):
        pass

The ConsoleExpectMixin is a mixin class to add expect functionality to any
class supporting the :any:`ConsoleProtocol` and has to be the first item in the
subclass list.
Using the mixin class allows sharing common code, which would otherwise need to
be added into multiple drivers.

::

    import attr

    from labgrid.driver.common import Driver
    from labgrid.driver.consoleexpectmixin import ConsoleExpectMixin
    from labgrid.protocol import ConsoleProtocol

    @attr.s(cmp=False)
    class ExampleDriver(ConsoleExpectMixin, Driver, ConsoleProtocol)
        pass

Additionally the driver needs to be registered with the :any:`target_factory`
and provide a bindings dictionary, so that the :any:`Target` can resolve
dependencies on other drivers or resources.

::

    import attr

    from labgrid.factory import target_factory
    from labgrid.driver.common import Driver
    from labgrid.driver.consoleexpectmixin import ConsoleExpectMixin
    from labgrid.protocol import ConsoleProtocol

    @target_factory.reg_driver
    @attr.s(cmp=False)
    class ExampleDriver(ConsoleExpectMixin, Driver, ConsoleProtocol)
        bindings = { "port": SerialPort }
        pass

The listed resource :code:`SerialPort` will be bound to :code:`self.port`,
making it usable in the class.
Checks are performed that the target which the driver binds to has a SerialPort,
otherwise an error will be raised.

If your driver can support alternative resources, you can use a set of classes
instead of a single class::

    bindings = { "port": {SerialPort, NetworkSerialPort}}

Optional bindings can be declared by including ``None`` in the set::

    bindings = { "port": {SerialPort, NetworkSerialPort, None}}

If you need to do something during instantiation, you need to add a
:code:`__attrs_post_init__` method (instead of the usual :code:`__init__` used
for non-attr-classes).
The minimum requirement is a call to :code:`super().__attrs_post_init__()`.

::

    import attr

    from labgrid.factory import target_factory
    from labgrid.driver.common import Driver
    from labgrid.driver.consoleexpectmixin import ConsoleExpectMixin
    from labgrid.protocol import ConsoleProtocol

    @target_factory.reg_driver
    @attr.s(cmp=False)
    class ExampleDriver(ConsoleExpectMixin, Driver, ConsoleProtocol)
        bindings = { "port": SerialPort }

        def __attrs_post_init__(self):
            super().__attrs_post_init__()

All that's left now is to implement the functionality described by the used
protocol, by using the API of the bound drivers and resources.

Writing a Resource
-------------------

To add a new resource to labgrid, we import attr into our new resource file.
Additionally we need the :any:`target_factory` and the common Resource class.

::

    import attr

    from labgrid.factory import target_factory
    from labgrid.driver.common import Resource

Next we add our own resource with the :code:`Resource` parent class and
register it with the :any:`target_factory`.

::

    import attr

    from labgrid.factory import target_factory
    from labgrid.driver.common import Resource

    @target_factory.reg_resource
    @attr.s(cmp=False)
    class ExampleResource(Resource):
        pass

All that is left now is to add attributes via :code:`attr.ib()` member
variables.

::

    import attr

    from labgrid.factory import target_factory
    from labgrid.driver.common import Resource

    @target_factory.reg_resource
    @attr.s(cmp=False)
    class ExampleResource(Resource):
        examplevar1 = attr.ib()
        examplevar2 = attr.ib()

The :code:`attr.ib()` style of member definition also supports defaults and
validators, see the `attrs documentation <https://attrs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

Writing a Strategy
------------------

Labgrid only offers two basic strategies, for complex use cases a customized
strategy is required.
Start by creating a strategy skeleton:

::

    import enum

    import attr

    from labgrid.step import step
    from labgrid.driver.common import Strategy

    class Status(enum.Enum):
        unknown = 0

    class MyStrategy(Strategy):
        bindings = {
        }

        status = attr.ib(default=Status.unknown)

        @step
        def transition(self, status, *, step):
            if not isinstance(status, Status):
                status = Status[status]
            if status == Status.unknown:
                raise StrategyError("can not transition to {}".format(status))
            elif status == self.status:
                step.skip("nothing to do")
                return  # nothing to do
            else:
                raise StrategyError(
                    "no transition found from {} to {}".
                    format(self.status, status)
                )
            self.status = status


The ``bindings`` variable needs to declare the drivers necessary for the
strategy, usually one for power, boot loader and shell.
The ``Status`` class needs to be extended to cover the states of your strategy,
then for each state an ``elif`` entry in the transition function needs to be
added.

Lets take a look at the builtin `BareboxStrategy`. The Status enum for Barebox:

::

   class Status(enum.Enum):
       unknown = 0
       off = 1
       barebox = 2
       shell = 3

defines 3 custom states and the `unknown` state as the start point.
These three states are handled in the transition function:

::

    elif status == Status.off:
        self.target.deactivate(self.barebox)
        self.target.deactivate(self.shell)
        self.target.activate(self.power)
        self.power.off()
    elif status == Status.barebox:
        self.transition(Status.off)
        # cycle power
        self.power.cycle()
        # interrupt barebox
        self.target.activate(self.barebox)
    elif status == Status.shell:
        # tansition to barebox
        self.transition(Status.barebox)
        self.barebox.boot("")
        self.barebox.await_boot()
        self.target.activate(self.shell)

Here the `barebox` state simply cycles the board and activates the driver, while
the `shell` state uses the barebox state to cycle the board and than boot the
linux kernel. The `off` states switch the power off.

Graph Strategies
----------------

.. warning::
    This feature is experimental and brings much complexity to your project.

GraphStrategies are made for more complex strategies, with multiple, on each
other depending, states. A GraphStrategy graph has to be a directed graph with
one root state.

Using a GraphStrategy makes only sense if you have board states that are
reachable by different ways. In this case GraphStrategies reduce state
duplication.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    # conftest.py
    from labgrid.strategy import GraphStrategy


    class TestStrategy(GraphStrategy):
        def state_Unknown(self):
            pass

        @GraphStrategy.depends('Unknown')
        def state_Boot_via_NAND(self):
            pass

        @GraphStrategy.depends('Unknown')
        def state_Boot_via_NFS(self):
            pass

        @GraphStrategy.depends('Boot_via_NAND', 'Boot_via_NFS')
        def state_BareBox(self):
            pass

        @GraphStrategy.depends('BareBox')
        def state_Linux_Shell(self):
            pass

.. code-block:: python

    # render graph to png
    >>> graph_strategy.graph.render('filename')
    'filename.png'

.. image:: res/graphstrategy-1.png

.. image:: res/graphstrategy-2.png

State
~~~~~

Every graph node describes a board state and how to reach it, A state
has to be a class method following this prototype:
`def state_$STATENAME(self):`. A state may not call `transition()` in its
state definition.

Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~

Every state, but the root state, can depend on other States, If a state has
multiple dependencies, not all of them, but one, have to be reached before
running the current state.
When no via is used during a transition the order of the given dependencies
decides which one gets called, where the first one has the highest priority
and the last one the lowest.
Dependencies are represented by graph edges.

Root State
~~~~~~~~~~

Every GraphStrategy has to has to define exactly one root state. The root state
defines the start of the graph and therefore the start of every transition.
A state becomes a root state if it has no dependencies.

Transition
~~~~~~~~~~

A transition describes a path, or a part of a path, through a GraphStrategy
graph.
Every State in the graph has a auto generated default path starting from the
root state.
So using the given example, the GraphStrategy would call the states `Unknown`
, `Boot_via_NAND`, `BareBox`, and `Linux_Shell` in this order if
`transition('Linux_Shell')` would be called.
The GraphStrategy would prefer `Boot_via_NAND` over `Boot_via_NFS` because
`Boot_via_NAND` is mentioned before `Boot_via_NFS` in the dependencies of
`BareBox`. If you want to reach via `Boot_via_NFS` the call would look like
this: `transition('Linux_Shell', via='Boot_via_NFS')`.

A transition can be incremental. If we trigger a transition
`transition('BareBox')` first, the states `Unknown`, `Boot_via_NAND` and
`BareBox` will be called in this order. If we trigger a transition
`transition('Linux_Shell')` afterwards only `Linux_Shell` gets called. This
happens because `Linux_Shell` is reachable from `BareBox` and the Strategy
holds state of the last walked path.
But there is a catch! The second, incremental path must be *fully* incremental
to the previous path!
For example: Lets say we reached `BareBox` via `Boot_via_NFS`,
(`transition('Barebox', via='Boot_via_NFS')`). If we trigger
`transition('Linux_Shell')` afterwards the GraphStrategy would compare the last
path `'Unknown', 'Boot_via_NFS', 'BareBox'` with the default path to
`Linux_Shell` which would be
`'Unknown', 'Boot_via_NAND', 'BareBox', 'Linux_Shell'`, and decides the path
is not fully incremental and starts over by the root state. If we had given
the second transition `Boot_via_NFS` like in the first transition the paths
had been incremental.


SSHManager
----------

Labgrid provides a SSHManager to allow connection reuse with control sockets.
To use the SSHManager in your code, import it from `labgrid.util.ssh`:

.. code-block:: python

   from labgrid.util.ssh import sshmanager

you can now request or remove forwards:

.. code-block:: python

   from labgrid.util.ssh import sshmanager

   localport = sshmanager.request_forward('somehost', 3000)

   sshmanager.remove_forward('somehost', 3000)

or get and put files:

.. code-block:: python

   from labgrid.util.ssh import sshmanager

   sshmanager.put_file('somehost', '/path/to/local/file', '/path/to/remote/file')

ManagedFile
-----------
While the `SSHManager` exposes a lower level interface to use SSH Connections,
the ManagedFile provides a higher level interface for file upload to another
host. It is meant to be used in conjunction with a remote resource, and store
the file on the remote host with the following pattern:

.. code-block:: bash

   /tmp/labgrid-<username>/<sha256sum>/<filename>

Additionally it provides `get_remote_path()` to retrieve the complete file path,
to easily employ it for driver implementations.
To use it in conjunction with a `Resource` and a file:

.. code-block:: python

   from labgrid.util.managedfile import ManagedFile

   mf = ManagedFile(<your-file>, <your-resource>)
   mf.sync_to_resource()
   path = mf.get_remote_path()

Unless constructed with `ManagedFile(..., detect_nfs=False)`, ManagedFile
employs the following heuristic to check if a file is on NFS and if so, foregoes
the transfer and `get_remote_path()` just returns the local path (which is
identical to the remote path in this case):

  - check if GNU coreutils stat(1) with option --format exists on local and
    remote system
  - check if inode number, total size and birth/modification timestamps match
    on local and remote system

ProxyManager
------------
The proxymanager is used to open connections across proxies via an attribute in
the resource. This allows gated testing networks by always using the exporter as
an SSH gateway to proxy the connections using SSH Forwarding. Currently this is
used in the `SerialDriver` for proxy connections.

Usage:

.. code-block:: python

   from labgrid.util.proxy import proxymanager

   proxymanager.get_host_and_port(<resource>)

.. _ideas:

Ideas
-----

.. please keep these sorted alphabetically

Driver Preemption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To allow better handling of unexpected reboots or crashes, inactive Drivers
could register callbacks on their providers (for example the BareboxDriver it's
ConsoleProtocol).
These callbacks would look for indications that the Target has changed state
unexpectedly (by looking for the bootloader startup messages, in this case).
The inactive Driver could then cause a preemption and would be activated.
The current caller of the originally active driver would be notified via an
exception.

Remote Target Reservation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For integration with CI systems (like Jenkins), it would help if the CI job
could reserve and wait for a specific target.
This could be done by managing a list of waiting users in the coordinator and
notifying the current user on each invocation of labgrid-client that another
user is waiting.
The reservation should expire after some time if it is not used to lock the
target after it becomes available.

Step Tracing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Step infrastructure already collects timing and nesting information on
executed commands, but is currently only used for in pytest or via the
standalone StepReporter.
By writing these events to a file (or sqlite database) as a trace, we can
collect data over multiple runs for later analysis.
This would become more useful by passing recognized events (stack traces,
crashes, ...) and benchmark results via the Step infrastructure.

Target Feature Flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It would be useful to support configuring feature flags in the target YAML
definition.
Then individual tests could be skipped if a required feature is unavailable on
the current target without manually modifying the test suite.

CommandProtocol Support for Background Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently the CommandProtocol does not support long running
processes well.
An implementation should start a new process,
return a handle and forbid running other processes in the foreground.
The handle can be used to retrieve output from a command.

SSH Tunneling for Remote Infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client and exporter require a direct HTTP(S) connection to the coordinator.
Also, the clients connect directly to the exporters via SSH.
However, often the clients are in an office network,
while exporters run in separate lab networks,
making it necessary to open holes in the firewall to
connect to the coordinator or from client to exporter.
In this case, it would be useful to use SSH as the authentication service
and then use tunneling to connect to the coordinator or
for the client to exporter connections.

Support for PDU-Daemon
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LAVA project developed their own daemon for power switching, the `PDU Daemon
<https://https://staging.validation.linaro.org/static/docs/v2/pdudaemon.html>`_.
Add support for the daemon in the NetworkPowerDriver.
