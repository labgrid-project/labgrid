Getting Started
===============

This section of the manual contains introductory tutorials for installing
labgrid, running your first test and setting up the distributed infrastructure.
For an overview about the basic design and components of `labgrid`, read the
:ref:`overview` first.

Installation
------------

Depending on your distribution you need some dependencies. On Debian stretch
and buster these usually are:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ apt-get install python3 python3-virtualenv python3-pip python3-setuptools virtualenv


In many cases, the easiest way is to install labgrid into a virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv -p python3 labgrid-venv
    $ source labgrid-venv/bin/activate

Start installing labgrid by cloning the repository and installing the
requirements from the `requirements.txt` file:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid
    $ cd labgrid && pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python3 setup.py install

.. note::
   Previous documentation recommended the installation as via pip (`pip3 install
   labgrid`).
   This lead to broken installations due to unexpected incompatibilities with
   new releases of the dependencies.
   Consequently we now recommend using pinned versions from the
   `requirements.txt` file for most use cases.

   labgrid also supports the installation as a library via pip, but we only
   test against library versions specified in the requirements.txt file.
   Thus when installing directly from pip you have to test compatibility
   yourself.

.. note::
   If you are installing via pip and intend to use Serial over IP (RFC2217),
   it is highly recommended to uninstall pyserial after installation and replace
   it with the pyserial version from the labgrid project:

      .. code-block:: bash

          $ pip uninstall pyserial
          $ pip install https://github.com/labgrid-project/pyserial/archive/v3.4.0.1.zip#egg=pyserial

   This pyserial version has two fixes for an Issue we found with Serial over IP
   multiplexers. Additionally it reduces the Serial over IP traffic considerably
   since the port is not reconfigured when labgrid changes the timeout (which is
   done inside the library a lot).


Test your installation by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ labgrid-client --help
    usage: labgrid-client [-h] [-x URL] [-c CONFIG] [-p PLACE] [-d] COMMAND ...
    ...

If the help for labgrid-client does not show up, open an `Issue
<https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid/issues>`_. If everything was
successful so far, proceed to the next section:

Optional Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
labgrid provides optional features which are not included in the default
`requirements.txt`. The tested library version for each feature is included in a
seperate requirements file. An example for snmp support is:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r snmp-requirements.txt

Onewire
+++++++
Onewire support requires the `libow` library with headers, installable on debian
via the `libow-dev` package. Use the `onewire-requirements.txt` file to install
the correct onewire library version in addition to the normal installation.

SNMP
++++
SNMP support requires to additional packages, `pysnmp` and `pysnmpmibs`. They
are included in the `snmp-requirements.txt` file.

Modbus
++++++
Modbus support requires an additional package `pyModbusTCP`. It is included in
the `modbus-requirements.txt` file.


Running Your First Test
-----------------------

Start by copying the initial example:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir ../first_test/
    $ cp examples/shell/* ../first_test/
    $ cd ../first_test/

Connect your embedded board (raspberry pi, riotboard, â€¦) to your computer and
adjust the ``port`` parameter of the ``RawSerialPort`` resource and ``username``
and ``password`` of the ShellDriver driver in ``local.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    targets:
      main:
        resources:
          RawSerialPort:
            port: "/dev/ttyUSB0"
        drivers:
          ManualPowerDriver:
            name: "example"
          SerialDriver: {}
          ShellDriver:
            prompt: 'root@\w+:[^ ]+ '
            login_prompt: ' login: '
            username: 'root'


You can check which device name gets assigned to your USB-Serial converter by
unplugging the converter, running ``dmesg -w`` and plugging it back in. Boot up
your board (manually) and run your first test:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytest --lg-env local.yaml test_shell.py

It should return successfully, in case it does not, open an `Issue
<https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid/issues>`_.

If you want to build documentation you need some more dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip3 install -r doc-requirements.txt

The documentation is inside ``doc/``.  HTML-Documentation is build using:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd doc/
   $ make html

The HTML documentation is written to ``doc/.build/html/``.

.. _remote-getting-started:

Setting Up the Distributed Infrastructure
-----------------------------------------

The labgrid :ref:`distributed infrastructure <remote-resources-and-places>`
consists of three components:

#. :ref:`overview-coordinator`
#. :ref:`overview-exporter`
#. :ref:`overview-client`

The system needs at least one coordinator and exporter, these can run on the
same machine. The client is used to access functionality provided by an
exporter. Over the course of this tutorial we will set up a coordinator and
exporter, and learn how to access the exporter via the client.

Coordinator
~~~~~~~~~~~

To start the coordinator, we will download the labgrid repository, create an
extra virtualenv and install the dependencies via the requirements file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid
    $ cd labgrid && virtualenv -p python3 crossbar_venv
    $ source crossbar_venv/bin/activate
    $ sudo apt install libsnappy-dev
    $ pip install -r crossbar-requirements.txt
    $ python setup.py install

All necessary dependencies should be installed now, we can start the coordinator
by running ``crossbar start`` inside of the repository.

.. note:: This is possible because the labgrid repository contains the crossbar
          configuration the coordinator in the ``.crossbar`` folder.
          crossbar is a network messaging framework for building distributed
          applications, which labgrid plugs into.

.. note:: For long running deployments, you should copy and customize the
	  ``.crossbar/config.yaml`` file for your use case. This includes
	  setting a different ``workdir`` and may include changing the running
	  port.

Exporter
~~~~~~~~

The exporter needs a configuration file written in YAML syntax, listing
the resources to be exported from the local machine.
The config file contains one or more named resource groups.
Each group contains one or more resource declarations and optionally a location
string (see the :doc:`configuration reference <configuration>` for details).

For example, to export a ``USBSerialPort`` with ``ID_SERIAL_SHORT`` of
``ID23421JLK``, the group name `example-group` and the location
`example-location`:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example-group:
     location: example-location
     USBSerialPort:
       ID_SERIAL_SHORT: ID23421JLK

.. note:: Use ``labgrid-suggest`` to generate the YAML snippets for most
	  exportable resources.

The exporter can now be started by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ labgrid-exporter configuration.yaml

Additional groups and resources can be added:

.. code-block:: yaml

   example-group:
     location: example-location
     USBSerialPort:
       match:
         'ID_SERIAL_SHORT': 'P-00-00682'
       speed: 115200
     NetworkPowerPort:
       model: netio
       host: netio1
       index: 3
   example-group-2:
     USBSerialPort:
       ID_SERIAL_SHORT: KSLAH2341J

Restart the exporter to activate the new configuration.

.. Attention::
   The `ManagedFile` will create temporary uploads in the exporters
   ``/var/cache/labgrid`` directory. This directory needs to be created manually
   and should allow write access for users. The ``/contrib`` directory in the
   labgrid-project contains a tmpfiles configuration example to automatically
   create and clean the directory.
   It is also highly recommended to enable ``fs.protected_regular=1`` and
   ``fs.protected_fifos=1`` for kernels>=4.19, to protect the users from opening
   files not owned by them in world writeable sticky directories.
   For more information see `this kernel commit`_.

.. _`this kernel commit`: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=30aba6656f

Client
~~~~~~

Finally we can test the client functionality, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ labgrid-client resources
    kiwi/example-group/NetworkPowerPort
    kiwi/example-group/NetworkSerialPort
    kiwi/example-group-2/NetworkSerialPort

You can see the available resources listed by the coordinator. The groups
`example-group` and `example-group-2` should be available there.

To show more details on the exported resources, use ``-v`` (or ``-vv``):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ labgrid-client -v resources
    Exporter 'kiwi':
      Group 'example-group' (kiwi/example-group/*):
        Resource 'NetworkPowerPort' (kiwi/example-group/NetworkPowerPort[/NetworkPowerPort]):
          {'acquired': None,
           'avail': True,
           'cls': 'NetworkPowerPort',
           'params': {'host': 'netio1', 'index': 3, 'model': 'netio'}}
    ...

You can now add a place with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ labgrid-client --place example-place create

And add resources to this place (``-p`` is short for ``--place``):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ labgrid-client -p example-place add-match */example-group/*

Which adds the previously defined resource from the exporter to the place.
To interact with this place, it needs to be acquired first, this is done by

.. code-block:: bash

    $ labgrid-client -p example-place acquire

Now we can connect to the serial console:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ labgrid-client -p example-place console

.. note:: Using remote connection requires ``microcom`` installed on the host
   where the labgrid-client is called.

See :ref:`remote-usage` for some more advanced features.
For a complete reference have a look at the :doc:`labgrid-client(1) <man/client>`
man page.

.. _udev-matching:

udev Matching
-------------

labgrid allows the exporter (or the client-side environment) to match resources
via udev rules.
The udev resources become available to the test/exporter as soon es they are
plugged into the computer, e.g. allowing an exporter to export all USB ports on
a specific hub and making a ``NetworkSerialPort`` available as soon as it is
plugged into one of the hub's ports.
labgrid also provides a small utility called ``labgrid-suggest`` which will
output the proper YAML formatted snippets for you.
The information udev has on a device can be viewed by executing:

.. code-block:: bash
   :emphasize-lines: 9

    $ udevadm info /dev/ttyUSB0
    ...
    E: ID_MODEL_FROM_DATABASE=CP210x UART Bridge / myAVR mySmartUSB light
    E: ID_MODEL_ID=ea60
    E: ID_PATH=pci-0000:00:14.0-usb-0:5:1.0
    E: ID_PATH_TAG=pci-0000_00_14_0-usb-0_5_1_0
    E: ID_REVISION=0100
    E: ID_SERIAL=Silicon_Labs_CP2102_USB_to_UART_Bridge_Controller_P-00-00682
    E: ID_SERIAL_SHORT=P-00-00682
    E: ID_TYPE=generic
    ...

In this case the device has an ``ID_SERIAL_SHORT`` key with a unique ID embedded
in the USB-serial converter.
The resource match configuration for this USB serial converter is:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :emphasize-lines: 3

   USBSerialPort:
     match:
       'ID_SERIAL_SHORT': 'P-00-00682'

This section can now be added under the resource key in an environment
configuration or under its own entry in an exporter configuration file.

As the USB bus number can change depending on the kernel driver initialization
order, it is better to use the ``@ID_PATH`` instead of ``@sys_name`` for USB
devices.
In the default udev configuration, the path is not available for all USB
devices, but that can be changed by creating a udev rules file:

.. code-block:: none

  SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", IMPORT{builtin}="path_id"


Using a Strategy
----------------

Strategies allow the labgrid library to automatically bring the board into a
defined state, e.g. boot through the bootloader into the Linux kernel and log in
to a shell. They have a few requirements:

- A driver implementing the ``PowerProtocol``, if no controllable infrastructure
  is available a ``ManualPowerDriver`` can be used.
- A driver implementing the ``LinuxBootProtocol``, usually a specific driver for
  the board's bootloader
- A driver implementing the ``CommandProtocol``, usually a ``ShellDriver`` with
  a ``SerialDriver`` below it.

labgrid ships with two builtin strategies, ``BareboxStrategy`` and
``UBootStrategy``. These can be used as a reference example for simple
strategies, more complex tests usually require the implementation of your own
strategies.

To use a strategy, add it and its dependencies to your configuration YAML,
retrieve it in your test and call the ``transition(status)`` function.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> strategy = target.get_driver(strategy)
   >>> strategy.transition("barebox")

An example using the pytest plugin is provided under `examples/strategy`.
