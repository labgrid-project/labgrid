# This driver implements a power port for Gude EPC-8316 Power Switches.
# These switches differ in their API to the previous switches for
# get-commands (because of a firmware bug).
#
# Apart from a workaround for this bug and reduced port index limits of
# 8 instead of 24, this implementation works just like gude24.py.
#
# Driver has been tested with:
# * Gude Expert Power Control 8316 (firmware v1.2.0)
