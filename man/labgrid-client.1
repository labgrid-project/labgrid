.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
.sp
The configuration file follows the description in \fBlabgrid\-device\-config\fP(5).
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
Various labgrid\-client commands use the following environment variable:
.SS LG_PLACE
.sp
This variable can be used to specify a place without using the \fB\-p\fP option, the \fB\-p\fP option overrides it.
.SS LG_TOKEN
.sp
This variable can be used to specify a reservation for the \fBwait\fP command and
for the \fB+\fP place expansion.
.SS LG_STATE
.sp
This variable can be used to specify a state which the device transitions into
before executing a command. Requires a configuration file and a Strategy
specified for the device.
.SS LG_ENV
.sp
This variable can be used to specify the configuration file to use without
using the \fB\-\-config\fP option, the \fB\-\-config\fP option overrides it.
.SS LG_CROSSBAR
.sp
This variable can be used to set the default crossbar URL (instead of using the
\fB\-x\fP option).
.SS LG_CROSSBAR_REALM
.sp
This variable can be used to set the default crossbar realm to use instead of
\fBrealm1\fP\&.
.SS LG_PROXY
.sp
This variable can be used to specify a SSH proxy hostname which should be used
to connect to the coordinator and any resources which are normally accessed
directly.
.SS LG_HOSTNAME
.sp
Override the hostname used when accessing a resource. Typically only useful for
CI pipelines where the hostname may not be consistent between pipeline stages.
.SS LG_USERNAME
.sp
Override the username used when accessing a resource. Typically only useful for
CI pipelines where the username may not be consistent between pipeline stages.
.SH MATCHES
.sp
Match patterns are used to assign a resource to a specific place. The format is:
exporter/group/cls/name, exporter is the name of the exporting machine, group is
a name defined within the exporter, cls is the class of the exported resource
and name is its name. Wild cards in match patterns are explicitly allowed, *
matches anything.

.SH ADDING NAMED RESOURCES
.sp
If a target contains multiple Resources of the same type, named matches need to
be used to address the individual resources. In addition to the \fImatch\fP taken by
\fIadd\-match\fP, \fIadd\-named\-match\fP also takes a name for the resource. The other
client commands support the name as an optional parameter and will inform the
user that a name is required if multiple resources are found, but no name is
given.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To retrieve a list of places run:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ labgrid\-client places
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To access a place, it needs to be acquired first, this can be done by running
the \fBacquire command\fP and passing the placename as a \-p parameter:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ labgrid\-client \-p <placename> acquire
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Open a console to the acquired place:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ labgrid\-client \-p <placename> console
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Add all resources with the group "example\-group" to the place example\-place:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ labgrid\-client \-p example\-place add\-match */example\-group/*/*
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
