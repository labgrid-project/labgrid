SYNOPSIS
--------

``labgrid-client`` ``--help``

``labgrid-client`` -p <place> <command>

``labgrid-client`` ``places|resources``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Labgrid is a scalable infrastructure and test architecture for embedded (linux) systems.

This is the client to control a boards status and interface with it on remote machines.

OPTIONS
-------
-h, --help
    display command line help
-p PLACE, --place PLACE
    specify the place to operate on
-x ADDRESS, --coordinator ADDRESS
    coordinator ``HOST[:PORT]`` to connect to, defaults to ``127.0.0.1:20408``
-c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
    set the configuration file
-s STATE, --state STATE
    set an initial state before executing a command, requires a configuration
    file and strategy
-i INITIAL_STATE, --initial-state INITIAL_STATE
    strategy state to force into before switching to desired state, requires a
    desired state (``-s``/``--state``/``LG_STATE``)
-d, --debug
    enable debugging
-v, --verbose
    increase verbosity
-P PROXY, --proxy PROXY
    proxy connections over ssh
-A, --auth
    enables gRPC connection authentication/authorization
-cp RELATIVE_PATH, --cert-path RELATIVE_PATH
    relative path to the SSL certificate file, defaults to ``certificates/server.crt``
-ap AUTH_PLUGIN_NAME, --auth-plugin AUTH_PLUGIN_NAME
    name of the entry point used to return an instance of the custom authentication plugin;
    by default, the ``DefaultAuthMetadataPlugin`` is used

-A / --auth
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This option enables gRPC connection authentication/authorization.

-cp / --cert-path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The relative path to the SSL certificate file used for the gRPC channel encryption,
defaults to ``certificates/server.crt``.
The value related to this option is considered only when the gRPC connection authentication is enabled.

-ap / --auth-plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The name of the entry point used to return an instance of the custom authentication plugin;
this plugin is delivered as an independent Python package (not part of the labgrid code base);
the authentication plugin is a class derived from the ``grpc.AuthMetadataPlugin`` class;
by default, the ``DefaultAuthMetadataPlugin`` is used, this default plugin is a part of the labgrid;
this parameter is only considered when the gRPC authorization/authentication is enabled


CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------
The configuration file follows the description in ``labgrid-device-config``\(5).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
Various labgrid-client commands use the following environment variable:

LG_PLACE
~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify a place without using the ``-p`` option, the ``-p`` option overrides it.

LG_TOKEN
~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify a reservation for the ``wait`` command and
for the ``+`` place expansion.

LG_STATE
~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify a state which the device transitions into
before executing a command. Requires a configuration file and a Strategy
specified for the device.

LG_INITIAL_STATE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify an initial state the device is known to
be in.
This is useful during development. The Strategy used must implement the
``force()`` method.
A desired state must be set using ``LG_STATE`` or ``-s``/``--state``.

LG_ENV
~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify the configuration file to use without
using the ``--config`` option, the ``--config`` option overrides it.

LG_COORDINATOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to set the default coordinator in the format
``HOST[:PORT]`` (instead of using the ``-x`` option).

LG_PROXY
~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify a SSH proxy hostname which should be used
to connect to the coordinator and any resources which are normally accessed
directly.

LG_HOSTNAME
~~~~~~~~~~~
Override the hostname used when accessing a resource. Typically only useful for
CI pipelines where the hostname may not be consistent between pipeline stages.

LG_USERNAME
~~~~~~~~~~~
Override the username used when accessing a resource. Typically only useful for
CI pipelines where the username may not be consistent between pipeline stages.

LG_SSH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Set the connection timeout when using SSH (The ``ConnectTimeout`` option). If
unspecified, defaults to 30 seconds.

MATCHES
-------
Match patterns are used to assign a resource to a specific place. The format is:
exporter/group/cls/name, exporter is the name of the exporting machine, group is
a name defined within the exporter, cls is the class of the exported resource
and name is its name. Wild cards in match patterns are explicitly allowed, *
matches anything.

ADDING NAMED RESOURCES
----------------------
If a target contains multiple Resources of the same type, named matches need to
be used to address the individual resources. In addition to the `match` taken by
`add-match`, `add-named-match` also takes a name for the resource. The other
client commands support the name as an optional parameter and will inform the
user that a name is required if multiple resources are found, but no name is
given.

If one of the resources should be used by default when no resource name is
explicitly specified, it can be named ``default``.

EXAMPLES
--------

To retrieve a list of places run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ labgrid-client places

To access a place, it needs to be acquired first, this can be done by running
the ``acquire command`` and passing the placename as a -p parameter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ labgrid-client -p <placename> acquire

Open a console to the acquired place:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ labgrid-client -p <placename> console

Add all resources with the group "example-group" to the place example-place:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ labgrid-client -p example-place add-match */example-group/*/*

To enable the default gRPC connection authentication

.. code-block:: bash

    $labgrid-client -A places
