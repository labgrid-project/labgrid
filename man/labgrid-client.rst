SYNOPSIS
--------

``labgrid-client`` ``--help``

``labgrid-client`` -p <place> <command>

``labgrid-client`` ``places|resources``

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Labgrid is a scalable infrastructure and test architecture for embedded (linux) systems.

This is the client to control a boards status and interface with it on remote machines.

OPTIONS
-------
-h, --help
    display command line help
-p PLACE, --place PLACE
    specify the place to operate on
-x, --crossbar-url
    the crossbar url of the coordinator, defaults to ``ws://127.0.0.1:20408/ws``
-c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
    set the configuration file
-s STATE, --state STATE
    set an initial state before executing a command, requires a configuration
    file and strategy
-d, --debug
    enable debugging
-v, --verbose
    increase verbosity
-P PROXY, --proxy PROXY
    proxy connections over ssh

CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------
The configuration file follows the description in ``labgrid-device-config``\(5).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
Various labgrid-client commands use the following environment variable:

LG_PLACE
~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify a place without using the ``-p`` option, the ``-p`` option overrides it.

LG_TOKEN
~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify a reservation for the ``wait`` command and
for the ``+`` place expansion.

LG_STATE
~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify a state which the device transitions into
before executing a command. Requires a configuration file and a Strategy
specified for the device.

LG_ENV
~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify the configuration file to use without
using the ``--config`` option, the ``--config`` option overrides it.

LG_CROSSBAR
~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to set the default crossbar URL (instead of using the
``-x`` option).

LG_CROSSBAR_REALM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to set the default crossbar realm to use instead of
``realm1``.

LG_PROXY
~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to specify a SSH proxy hostname which should be used
to connect to the coordinator and any resources which are normally accessed
directly.

LG_HOSTNAME
~~~~~~~~~~~
Override the hostname used when accessing a resource. Typically only useful for
CI pipelines where the hostname may not be consistent between pipeline stages.

LG_USERNAME
~~~~~~~~~~~
Override the username used when accessing a resource. Typically only useful for
CI pipelines where the username may not be consistent between pipeline stages.

MATCHES
-------
Match patterns are used to assign a resource to a specific place. The format is:
exporter/group/cls/name, exporter is the name of the exporting machine, group is
a name defined within the exporter, cls is the class of the exported resource
and name is its name. Wild cards in match patterns are explicitly allowed, *
matches anything.

``reservations``                List current reservations

ADDING NAMED RESOURCES
----------------------
If a target contains multiple Resources of the same type, named matches need to
be used to address the individual resources. In addition to the `match` taken by
`add-match`, `add-named-match` also takes a name for the resource. The other
client commands support the name as an optional parameter and will inform the
user that a name is required if multiple resources are found, but no name is
given.

EXAMPLES
--------

To retrieve a list of places run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ labgrid-client places

To access a place, it needs to be acquired first, this can be done by running
the ``acquire command`` and passing the placename as a -p parameter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ labgrid-client -p <placename> acquire

Open a console to the acquired place:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ labgrid-client -p <placename> console

Add all resources with the group "example-group" to the place example-place:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ labgrid-client -p example-place add-match */example-group/*/*
