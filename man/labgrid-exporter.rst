SYNOPSIS
--------

``labgrid-exporter`` ``--help`` 

``labgrid-exporter`` ``*.yaml`` 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Labgrid is a scalable infrastructure and test architecture for embedded (linux) systems.

This is the man page for the exporter, supporting the export of serial ports,
USB devices and various other controllers.

OPTIONS
-------
-h, --help
    display command line help
-x, --crossbar-url
    the crossbar url of the coordinator
-i, --isolated
    enable isolated mode (always request SSH forwards)
-n, --name
    the public name of the exporter
--hostname
    hostname (or IP) published for accessing resources

-i / --isolated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This option enables isolated mode, which causes all exported resources marked
as requiring SSH connection forwarding.
Isolated mode is useful when resources (such as NetworkSerialPorts) are not
directly accessible from the clients.
The client will then use SSH to create a port forward to the resource when
needed.

-n / --name
~~~~~~~~~~~
This option is used to configure the exporter name under which resources are
registered with the coordinator, which is useful when running multiple
exporters on the same host.
It defaults to the system hostname.

--hostname
~~~~~~~~~~
For resources like USBSerialPort, USBGenericExport or USBSigrokExport, the
exporter needs to provide a host name to set the exported value of the "host"
key.
If the system hostname is not resolvable via DNS, this option can be used to
override this default with another name (or an IP address).

CONFIGURATION
-------------
The exporter uses a YAML configuration file which defines groups of releated
resources.
Furthermore the exporter can start helper binaries such as ``ser2net`` to
export local serial ports over the network.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
The following environment variable can be used to configure labgrid-exporter.

LG_CROSSBAR
~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to set the default crossbar URL (instead of using the
``-x`` option).

LG_CROSSBAR_REALM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable can be used to set the default crossbar realm to use instead of
``realm1``.

EXAMPLES
--------

Start the exporter with the configuration file `my-config.yaml`:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ labgrid-exporter my-config.yaml

Same as above, but with name ``myname``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ labgrid-exporter -n myname my-config.yaml
