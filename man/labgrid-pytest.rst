SYNOPSIS
--------

``pytest --lg-env`` ``*.yaml`` 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Labgrid ships a pytest plugin to integrate with the pytest infrastructure. It is
activated if the `--lg-env` parameter is supplied to the pytest command.

The labgrid plugin parses the supplied configuration yaml file as described in
``labgrid-device-config``\(1) and allows the usage of the target and environment
fixtures.
The complete documentation is available at
https://labgrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#pytest-plugin.

EXAMPLES
--------

Start tests with ``myconfig.yaml`` and directory ``tests``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pytest --lg-env myconfig.yaml tests
